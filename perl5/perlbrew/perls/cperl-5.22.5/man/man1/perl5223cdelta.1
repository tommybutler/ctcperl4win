installperl ensures now that \fI\f(CI$prefix\fI/bin/perl\fR is created. (#144)
This fixes \fBperlbrew\fR without explicit cperl support, and needs special care
for packagers not to overwrite an existing \fIbin/perl\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
New reader \f(CW\*(C`CHECK_type_ATTRIBUTES\*(C'\fR callbacks are called within the check
phase for every attribute, falling back to \f(CW\*(C`FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Less \f(CW\*(C`\-Wnonnull\-compare\*(C'\fR compilation warnings, use more \f(CW\*(C`_NN\*(C'\fR macros.
I.e. dont check for arguments which cannot be null.

cperl 5.22.3 represents approximately 3 weeks of development since Perl 5.22.2c
and contains approximately 2,800 lines of changes across 72 files from 1
author.
.PP
Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 410 lines of changes to 34 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.
.PP
Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community
of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the
improvements that became Perl 5.22.3:
.PP
Reini Urban, ribasushi.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \f(CW\*(C`perlbug\*(C'\fR program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR,
will be sent off to \f(CW\*(C`perlbug@perl.org\*(C'\fR to be analysed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at <https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to \f(CW\*(C`perl5\-security\-report@perl.org\*(C'\fR.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the p5p core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
\&\s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
If you trust the cperl developers more, please send an email to
them. The p5p security teams skips many security issues, or are
unwilling to fix them.
